Summary of pre-tag testing:

Summarize any change to answers:

  - what code configurations:
  - what platforms/compilers:
  - nature of change [(roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
    climate)]:

[If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?]

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
